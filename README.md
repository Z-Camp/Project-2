# Project-2 Cardio Charts App

So you want to start getting into shape, but you've tried exercising before and you know that fitness is a marathon and not a sprint, and you know how easy it is to get discouraged because you don't see immediate results. With the Cardio Charts, you can get rid of that feeling of discouragement and stay on track towards achieving your fitness goals. Cardio Charts  allows users to choose from a variety of cardiovascular exercises: walking, running, swimming and cycling. Once the user chooses an exercise, they are able to log information about the exercise that they performed, that information being: distance traveled, duration of the exercise, and the date that the user performed the exercise. This information is logged and used to generate a chart that visualizes the information. So, even though a user may not be seeing the desired results in the mirror, with Cardio Charts, they can always look back at the steps they've already made in achieving their fitness goals, and see the progress that they have made. Cardio Charts App also includes a BMI and a pace calculator. This information isn't saved for the user, but it does save them time from having to go to a search engine and find these on their own.
